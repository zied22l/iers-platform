# Intelligent Employee Recommendation System (PI)

This project is a web-based platform designed to help HR departments and managers
recommend the most suitable employees for activities such as trainings, projects,
missions, certifications, and audits.

The system relies on employee skills, experience, contextual priorities, and
explainable AI-based scoring to support decision-making.
